# code-obfuscation
Obfuscation is done in software to make the codes less understandable.
Its purpose is security and privacy. 
The tools we call obfuscator are things that make the code we write more difficult to understand, that is, obfuscate.
In other words, the obfuscation process does not affect the functioning of the code, it only makes the code more misunderstandable. 
In this project, I obfuscated the js codes both with a simple obfuscator I made and with a ready-made library called javascript-obfuscator.
