# code-obfuscation
Obfuscation is done in software to make the codes less understandable.
Its purpose is security and privacy. 
The tools we call obfuscator are things that make the code we write more difficult to understand, that is, obfuscate.
In other words, the obfuscation process does not affect the functioning of the code, it only makes the code more misunderstandable.

In this project, I obfuscated js codes with both a simple obfuscator I made and a ready-made library called javascript-obfuscator. I ran the same sample code with both obfuscators. I got different but quite complex, hard to understand codes. I also obfuscated the js codes in the react project that I had created before with the help of javascript obfuscator. You can find the obfuscated version and the unobfuscated version in the relevant folder [github.com](https://github.com/melikeNur/code-obfuscation/tree/master/counter-app(obfuscatedMyReactApp)
